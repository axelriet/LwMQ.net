LwMQ is a lightweight, brokerless, zero-configuration, high-performance, and modern message queuing layer supporting request-reply, pub-sub, broadcast, and fan-out over multiple protocols, including TCP, UDP, QUIC, PGM, RDMA (Infiniband, iWARP) as well as local and to/from virtual machines and containers through hypervisor-specific protocols.
